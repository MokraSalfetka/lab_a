            <p class="paragraph">
                The M4A4 is a carbine used by military forces worldwide. It is a lightweight, air-cooled, gas-operated, 
                magazine-fed semi-automatic rifle. The M4 carbine (officially Carbine, Caliber 5.56 mm, M4) is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault 
                rifle developed in the United States during the 1980s. It is a shortened version of the M16A2 assault rifle.

                The M4 is extensively used by the US military, with <u>decisions</u> to largely replace the M16 rifle in US Army (starting 2010) 
                and US Marine Corps (starting 2016) combat units as the primary infantry weapon and service rifle. The M4 has been 
                adopted by over 60 countries worldwide, and has been described as "one of the defining firearms of the 21st century".

            <h3 class="section-title">Accuracy</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">
                In a study conducted by the Army Marksmanship Unit, they found that at a distance of 300 yd (270 m), the 
                M16 achieved a 24 in (610 mm) grouping, and the M4 achieved a 32 in (810 mm) grouping, which dropped to 12 in (300 mm) and 
                18 in (460 mm) respectively when using match grade ammunition. As the average male torso is 18–19 in (460–480 mm) wide, 
                author Chris McNab concluded that this meant the M4 can be consistently accurate up to 300 yards, and noted that the frequent 
                usage of optical attachments meant it could be accurate to higher ranges.
